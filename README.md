## Description
This repository contains C programming projects completed as part of CSE-13S: Computer Systems and C Programming at UCSC. The projects demonstrate skills in:

- C programming and problem solving  
- Input handling and validation  
- Makefile usage for compilation  
- Writing test scripts  
- Basic data visualization  

Each project is organized into its own subfolder with its own README containing details about the project, files, compilation, and usage.
