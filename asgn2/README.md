## Description
This repository contains two C programming projects completed as part of CSE-13S coursework at UCSC. Both projects demonstrate **C programming skills, input handling, error checking, Makefile usage, and basic data visualization**.  

### Projects Included

1. **Histogram**  
   - Takes user inputs and visualizes them as a histogram using asterisks.  
   - Doubles values outside the range `[0,16)`  
   - Includes testing scripts and a Makefile for compilation.  
   - **See [`Histogram/README.md`](./Histogram/README.md) for details.**

2. **Coolness**  
   - Calculates a “coolness” value based on temperature and wind speed.  
   - Handles multiple input scenarios and includes error checking.  
   - Includes testing scripts and a Makefile for compilation.  
   - **See [`Coolness/README.md`](./Coolness/README.md) for details.**

## Skills Demonstrated

- C programming, input handling, and command-line arguments  
- Error handling and validation  
- Using Makefiles for project compilation  
- Writing test scripts to verify program correctness  
- ASCII-based data visualization (Histogram)

## How to Compile & Run

Each project contains its own `Makefile`. To compile a project:  
1. Navigate to the project directory (e.g., `Histogram` or `Coolness`).  
2. Run:
```
make
```
3. Execute the program as described in the respective project README.
